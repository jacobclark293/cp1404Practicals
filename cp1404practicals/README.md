# Jacob Clark's CP1404 Practicals
This repository contains the completed code for the practicals in the
CP1404 subject at James Cook University (JCU).

## About me
My name is Jacob Clark and I study a Bachelor
of Science, majoring in Mathematics and Data Science 
at JCU.

I have learnt that clean code is important in programming.
Here are three main lessons I have learned about 
"clean code":

- Clean code improves readability of the code, for yourself and others
- Always choose the right tool for the job
- Use functions and be sure to leave meaningful comments
